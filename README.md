## Collect data from twitter

An http client using the twitter APIs, pulls all tweets
for a specific geographical region containing specific
text associated with a set of programming languages.

Raw data is stored in a local database for further analysis.


## Data cleanup and analysis

Clean up data removing unrelated tweets and group it by date/region/country.

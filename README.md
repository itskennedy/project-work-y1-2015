# The coolest programming language

By collecting data from twitter users, you require to infer the trending programming languages in the European states on the last two year.

A similar project, for USA states, can be found here http://mashable.com/2015/01/06/maps-programming-languages-states/

The project can be split up in the following phases:
-  Collect data from twitter
-  Data cleanup and analysis
-  Presentation
-  Optional: Deploy on Microsoft Azure or AWS


## Collect data from twitter

An http client using the twitter APIs, pulls all tweets on the last two years
for a specific geographical region containing specific
text associated with a set of programming languages. 

Raw data is stored in a local database for further analysis.

## Data cleanup and analysis

Clean up and analyze the data from the raw data collected.

### Data Clean up

Analyze and implement some methodologies for clean up the data and removing unrelated tweets.

For example check the hashtag and the social graph of the user.

### Data analysis

Grouping the tweets by months of the year/state of the last 2 years implement the following analysis:
- Calculate the rate per month of any language considered and normalize the counted tweets, so that all languages together have a score of 100%.
- Determine the rate change of any language considered from the previous month.
- Determine the language with the greatest rate and the gratest rate change grouped by year/state.

Optional: Analyze and implement some methodologies to weigh the tweet. 
For example use the number of followers of the user.

## Presentation

Build a webapp to display the results obtained from the data analysis.

Optional: display the results as a chart.

### Optional: Deploy on Microsoft Azure or AWS

Deploy the applications on Microsoft Azure or AWS.
